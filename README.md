# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this project was to create a study guide for pre-work content for the edx, skills for life bootcamp. I was also motivated to complete and build this project as it gave me the fundamental understandings of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (js) which I will hopefully build upon in the near future. Completing this projext also solved a few issues. Firstly it solved a lack of understanding of the principles of HTML, CSS and JS. Also, it has given me one, organised, place to compile all my notes so that I can access them easily and read through them quickly due to the nature of the presentation. I learnt a lot from this project. As mentioned, I learnt the fundamentals of JS, CSS and HTMl. I also began to explore the git workflow process and how to create branches, implement pull requests and navigate through Gitbash.

Additionally, if the console is opened within the browser, JS can be viewed and will list the topics learnt from the pre-work content and will also choose a topic to study first.
